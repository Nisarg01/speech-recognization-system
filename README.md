# About speech-recognization-system
This is my implementation of course project about building a speech recognization sytem. Thanks Ming Li (Professor at SYSU-CMU Joint Institute of Engineering) very much for his excellent teaching. Also, I wanna express my deep gratitude to my family, my mum, my dad, who have always cared about me, supported and helped me.

I love artificial intelligence and machine learning, and this could be my first big project in the field of natural language processing. I will try my best to finish it in the next few months.

# Progress report of the project
